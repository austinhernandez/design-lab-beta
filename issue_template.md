### Help type
What kind of help do you need? Choose one or a few:

* I'm not sure: I'd like to have a half-hour conversation with a Lab editor to discuss the content.
* Generative: I'd like help coming up with and fleshing out ideas for a piece of writing.
* Developmental: I'd like help structuring and planning a piece of writing.
* Stylistic: I'd like help shifting the voice and tone of a piece I've already written.
* Copy editing: I'd like someone to copy edit my finished piece of writing.

_If you request copy editing, but your piece isn't quite ready for it, lab editors will re-tag the issue and get in touch to discuss how best to help._

### Time estimate or length
How much time in minutes or hours do you think you’ll need? If you're not sure, just let us know roughly how long you expect the piece to be (in words or pages).

_Copy editing always takes at least 30 minutes. For longer documents, estimate at least 15 min per page to allow enough time for thorough review._
